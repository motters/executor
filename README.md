# Executor

This project is to create an easy, secure method of executing OS commands.

The end goal is to be able to configure and control an OS with a simple config file. 
This will then allow a developer to focus on front end interface and not worry about how to execute the OS commands.

# Development 

This system is still under development and will not be able to be used in an application for a while
